Workflow Overview for CT Scan Classification MVP using ImageNet Pre-trained 2D CNNs

1. Data Loading & Preprocessing:
   - Load the CT scan volume from DICOM or similar formats.
   - Extract individual 2D slices from the volume.
   - Preprocess each slice: resize to the model's expected dimensions (e.g., 224x224), convert single-channel CT images to a 3-channel format, normalize pixel values, and apply any modality-specific adjustments (such as intensity windowing).

2. Inference on Slices:
   - Feed each preprocessed 2D slice into the ImageNet pre-trained CNN.
   - Record the output scores or probabilities for each class for every slice.

3. Aggregation of Results:
   - Combine the slice-level predictions (e.g., averaging probabilities or using majority voting) to derive a final classification decision for the entire CT scan.

4. Final Output:
   - Present the aggregated classification result along with confidence scores, constituting the final output of the MVP.
